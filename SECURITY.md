#  SECURITY PROTOCOL - OMNI-NEXUS SYSTEMS

At **CIPHER INTELLIGENCE LABS**, the security of our neural frameworks and the integrity of our reconnaissance logic are paramount. This document outlines the **Sovereign Disclosure Protocol** for the **CIPHER-OSINT v7.0 [OMNI-NEXUS]** project.

##  SUPPORTED VERSIONS

Only the **Zenith Branch (v7.0)** is currently under active neural monitoring and security maintenance.

| VERSION | STATUS | SECURITY SUPPORT |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **v5.0 [OMNI-NEXUS]** | `ZENITH` | ✅ FULL SUPPORT |
| **v4.x [DEEP-THINKER]** | `DEPRECATED` | ❌ NO SUPPORT |
| **v1.x - v3.x** | `LEGACY` | ❌ NO SUPPORT |

##  VULNERABILITY TRIAGE PROTOCOL

If you discover a security flaw within our **Scraper Engines**, **AI Orchestrator**, or **Ghost Protocol Gateway**, we request that you initiate a **Private Handshake** rather than a public disclosure. 

###  REPORTING CHANNELS
To report a critical vulnerability, please utilize the following encrypted-style channels:

*   **Primary Node (Telegram):** [t.me/cipher_attacks](https://t.me/cipher_attacks)
*   **Direct Architect Handshake:** Reach out to **Biruk Getachew (CIPHER)** for high-level triage.

###  REPORT REQUIREMENTS
Please include the following metadata in your report:
1.  **Vulnerability Class:** (e.g., Prompt Injection, Proxy Leak, Buffer Overflow).
2.  **Impact Score:** (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM).
3.  **Proof of Concept (PoC):** Detailed steps to replicate the link failure.
4.  **Recommended Mitigation:** Your architectural advice for a neural patch.

---

##  OUR COMMITMENT (TIMELINE)

Once a valid handshake is established, the **Architect** will:
1.  **Acknowledge Handshake:** Within **12-24 hours**.
2.  **Triage & Analysis:** Within **48 hours**.
3.  **Neural Patching:** A secure update will be pushed to the `main` node as a priority.
4.  **Credit:** Researchers who report valid vulnerabilities in good faith will be immortalized in the **CIPHER HALL OF FAME** (Release Notes).

## ⚖️ ETHICAL CONDUCT & SAFE HARBOR

**CIPHER-OSINT** is a Sovereign-Grade Intelligence Framework. We strongly advocate for **Ethical Reconnaissance**. 

*   **Authorized Testing Only:** We do not condone the use of this framework for malicious exfiltration or illegal espionage.
*   **Good Faith Research:** Any research performed on this tool to harden its defenses is highly encouraged and protected under our "Safe Harbor" policy.
*   **Responsibility:** The end-user is solely responsible for their tactical operations.
